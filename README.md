"TaskHero: Local Gig and Errand Marketplace"

Concept: TaskHero connects people in local communities who need help with tasks and errands (e.g., grocery shopping, dog walking, home cleaning, minor repairs) with those willing to perform them for a fee. Itâ€™s essentially a marketplace for micro-jobs, allowing users to earn extra money by helping others or save time by outsourcing small tasks.
